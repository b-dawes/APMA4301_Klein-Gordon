1. check m = 0 case
2. sigmoid or logistic dampening ("turn-on" function)
3. try to do a convergence plot to a point-charge analytic solution
4. random other sources
   a. take in a real function and do a fft on it for the source f_k?
   b. current (shouldn't need a "turn-on" function)
   c. dipole (no "turn-on", or non-symmetric charge (still needs "turn-on")
